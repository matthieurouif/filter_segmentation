1. Introduction.
#################

This software library implements the spectral clustering algorithm
described in:
     Spectral Matting
     Anat Levin, Alex Rav-Acha and Dani Lischinski, 
     In IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and 
     Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2007.

This software can be used freely for research purposes.
This code has been compiled and tasted using matlab7. We noticed
problems with earlier matlab versions.

For the components-grouping we wrapped to matlab the 'mincut' library of
Vladimir Kolmogorov (vnk@cs.cornell.edu) and Yuri Boykov (yuri@csd.uwo.ca),
described in
     An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms
     for Energy Minimization in Vision.
     Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov.
     In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 
     September 2004

(This software is also available at: 
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/vnk/software.html)

Note: When a small number of clusters is used, the code can be 
run without compiling the max-flow code.

2. How to use.
################

a. Compile the mincut library using 'compile_mincut'. As mentioned before, 
   this is not needed when using a small number of clusters.

b. To re-create some of the examples that were shown in the paper,
   use 'runAll'.

c. To compute only alpha components (without grouping), one can use:
     alpha_comps = SpectralMatting(prefix, downSmp, [], eigs_num, nclust);
